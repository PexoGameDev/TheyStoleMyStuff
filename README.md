# TheyStoleMyStuff
Unity's AI playground for me.

I tried playing with AI more so I decided to write a simple stealth game in which you have to steal some object and get out of the building without guards catching you.

I focused mostly on making guards "smart". 

I considered turning this playground project into a real game, but for now I declare it suspdended.
